# MakeCode Arcade “Short” Image Encoding

A more convenient format for sharing MakeCode Arcade serialized images (`` img`...` ``).

See a demo at https://makecode-short-image.vercel.app/.

You’ll find a single large `textarea` that accepts `` img`...` `` formatted data. The URL of the page dynamically updates in response to new image data being pasted into the `textarea`. A link to the page can be shared to conveniently share the same image.

## Encoding Format

### Base58

The short image format employs a [`Base58` encoding scheme](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-02.html). This was chosen for [several reasons](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-02.html#section-1-2):

-   Base58’s alphabet contains only URL-safe characters; including a short-encoded image in a URL will not incur any bloat from URL encoding.
-   Base58’s alphabet does not contain any word-breaking characters. A short-encoded image won’t linebreak when pasted into a messaging/email application.
-   Moreover, with no word-breaking characters, simply double-clicking will select a whole shortened image as a single word.

The last two benefits would be especially useful if MakeCode Arcade someday adds native support for pasting this (or a similar) format.

### Header

| byte # | bit offset | data                                  |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1      | 4–7        | version identifier (`0010` or `0001`) |
| 1      | 0–3        | high 4 bits of a 12-bit image width   |
| 2      | 0–7        | low 8 bits of a 12-bit image width    |

Image widths are represented as a 12-bit value. Widths may range from 1–4,095 (zero is invalid).

### Encoding schemes

#### v2 (default)

Data is grouped into series of `repeated pixels` and `non repeated pixels`. Each grouping is indicated with a `length` designator that specifies the **type** and **length** of the next grouping.

**Repeated** pixel data contains the repeated pixel value with the length designator.

The repeat threshold can be left up to the implementation (an implementation could even implement a dynamic repeat threshold). A minimum size of 3 repeated values seems to strike a good balance between optimizing short repeated runs and flipping back and forth between non-grouped and grouped instructions too often.

**Non-repeated** pixel data follows the instruction and is packed as described in the [v1 encoding](#v1).

##### Type + length instruction format

| high 4-bits              | low 4-bits               | type         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| non-zero length (1–15\*) | pixel value              | repeated     |
| zero                     | non-zero length (1–15\*) | non-repeated |

When `length >= 15`, there is special behavior:

The following byte is `additional length` and it contains any remaining length. This byte is **required**, even if the length is exactly `15`—in which case, the following byte will contain `0`.

If the remaining length is `>= 255` (larger than a single following byte can represent), the following-following byte is additional length, following the same rules, etc.

#### v1

Pairs of consecutive pixel values are packed into a single byte

| byte # | bit offset | data                 |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 3+     | 0–3        | fist pixel of pair   |
|        | 4–7        | second pixel of pair |

When the total image pixel count (`width ✖️ num rows`) is odd, the last packed pixel leaves the second value zeroed out, and it is trimmed during decoding.
